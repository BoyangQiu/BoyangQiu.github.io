## About Boyang
***

Over the course of my molecular biology research experiences, the one thing I found the most interesting was uncovering the hidden insights in my messy research data. The feeling of "Eureka!" from discovering a novel lead after crunching the numbers was one of pure gratification. It was this feeling which propelled me to contribute to the first known publication of the [human shoulder microbiome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29908759/), as well as contributing to the [field of Nemaline Myopathy therapeutic research.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6777365/)

I decided to pursue this feeling after graduating with my Master of Science from the University of Toronto by committing to the field of data science. I am actively working to bolster my knowledge of machine learning techniques and data science frameworks through independent projects. 

My current active project is building a neural network to predict the next pitch a pitcher will throw. Check it out below:
